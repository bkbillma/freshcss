FreshCSS is a bit of javascript (currently jQuery) which automatically reloads your CSS so you don't have to.  In version one it is made to only work with one css file and is pretty limited.  I have seen Chrome throw fits after having a page open for a while but Firefox and IE have done fine for me so far.
